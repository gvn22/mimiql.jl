# mimiql
uses simple ODEs to mimic low-mode/high-mode dynamics of GQL as well as of the low-mode/second-cumulant dynamics of GCE2.

Both solutions are solved using an RK4 scheme starting with the same initial conditions. The parameter space is reduced to 2 dimensions by normalizing with the linear friction coefficient, such that the parameters manipulated are the non-linear coefficient and low-mode source term.
